\title{Scatterplot of environmental parameters associated with species occurrence data.}
\usage{
scatterplot(taxon, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxon}{string: (optional) query of the form field:value (e.g. "genus:Macropus") 
or a free text search (e.g. "macropodidae"). Note that a free-text search is 
equivalent to specifying the "text" field (i.e. \code{taxon="Alaba"} is 
equivalent to \code{taxon="text:Alaba"}. 
The text field is populated with the taxon name along with a handful of other 
commonly-used fields, and so just specifying your target taxon (e.g. taxon="Alaba vibex") 
will probably work. However, for reliable results it is recommended to use a 
specific field where possible (see \code{nbn_fields("occurrence_indexed")} for 
valid fields). It is also good practice to quote the taxon name if it contains 
multiple words, for example \code{taxon="taxon_name:\"Alaba vibex\""}}

\item{\dots}{: other options passed to occurrences()}
}
\value{
Data frame of occurrence results, with one row per occurrence record. 
The columns of the dataframe will depend on the requested fields. The data 
frame is plotted with ggplot and output stored as pdf, an interactive ggplot
using plotly is displayed on-screen.
}
\description{
Interactive plotly plot of environmental variables and species occurrence data. 
WARNING: This function is under development and its functionality is limited
Makes a search using \code{\link{occurrences}}and plots environmental variables 
associated with species presence against each other. Alternatively, makes a 
search using \code{\link{occurrences}}and plots species occurrence data e.g 
frequencies against environmental variables. Note that there is a limit of 
500000 records per request when using \code{method="indexed"}. Use the 
\code{method="offline"} for larger requests. For small requests, 
\code{method="indexed"} likely to be faster.
