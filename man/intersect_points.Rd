\title{Intersect environmental or contextual layers at a given a set of points (coordinates)}
\usage{
intersect_points(
  pnts,
  layers,
  SPdata.frame = FALSE,
  use_layer_names = TRUE,
  verbose = sbdi_config()$verbose
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pnts}{numeric: vector of latitude/longitude pairs, or a 2 column data.frame or matrix of lat,lons. NOTE: the number of locations must be less than 1000.}

\item{layers}{string vector: ids of layers to be intersected. The list of possible layers is available from \code{sbdi_fields("layers")}. Names can be passed as full layer names (e.g. "Radiation - lowest period (Bio22)") rather than id ("el871"). Note: if more than one location has been provided in \code{pnts}, the number of layers must be less than 700.}

\item{SPdata.frame}{logical: should the output should be returned as a SpatialPointsDataFrame of the sp package or simply as a data.frame?}

\item{use_layer_names}{logical: if TRUE, layer names will be used as column names in the returned data frame (e.g. "radiationLowestPeriodBio22"). Otherwise, layer id value will be used for column names (e.g. "el871")}

\item{verbose}{logical: show additional progress information? [default is set by \code{\link{sbdi_config}}]}
}
\value{
A SpatialPointsDataFrame containing the intersecting data information. Missing data or incorrectly identified layer id values will result in NA data
}

 # single point with multiple layers
 layers <- c('el10016','el10009')

 # multiple points as a grid sampling multiple layers
 pnts <- data.frame(expand.grid(lat=seq(51.5074,52.5074),
                                lon=seq(0.1278,0.1278)))

This function allows the user to sample environmental/contextual layers at arbitrary locations. It complements 
the \code{\link{occurrences}} function, which allows values of the same set of layers to be downloaded at 
species occurrence locations.
NOTE: batch requests (multiple points) are currently processed in a *single queue* on the SBDI servers. Processing times may be slow if there are many requests in the queue. Note also that the actual processing of batch requests is inherently slow: a large number of points may take quite some time. Be warned.
