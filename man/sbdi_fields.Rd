\title{Retrieves a list of all field names that can be used with data retrieval functions}
\usage{
sbdi_fields(fields_type, as_is = TRUE)

field_info(field_id, maxrows = 50, record_count_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fields_type}{text: one of the following
\itemize{
\item "general" - for searching taxa, datasets, layers, and collections metadata
\item "occurrence" - for species occurrence records
\item "occurrence_stored" - can be returned as part of a species occurrence record search (equivalent to \code{subset(sbdi_fields("occurrences"),stored)})
\item "occurrence_indexed" - can be queried as part of a species occurrence record search (equivalent to \code{subset(sbdi_fields("occurrences"),indexed)})
\item "layers" - fields associated with the environmental and contextual layers. For additional information 
on layers, including metadata and licensing, see \code{\link{search_layers}}
\item "assertions" - potential issues flagged on one or more occurrence record fields
}}

\item{as_is}{logical: if TRUE, leave the field names as they are returned from the ALA web services. Arguments that are passed
directly to the ALA's web services (e.g. parameter \code{fq} in \code{\link{occurrences}}) should use field names in this format. If \code{as_is} is FALSE, the returned $names entries will be modified to make them consistent with the corresponding column names in R data.frames returned by e.g. \code{\link{occurrences}}. \code{as_is=FALSE} has no effect when \code{fields_type} is "layers". Note that prior to v1.20, \code{as_is=FALSE} did not work correctly.}

\item{field_id}{text: id of environmental/contextual layer field for which to look up information
Prepend "el" for "environmental" (grided) layers and "cl" for "contextual" (polygonal) layers}

\item{maxrows}{integer: maximum number of records to download. Some contextual layers (those with \code{field_id}s starting with "cl") have a very large number of records and attempting to download the full set can cause R to crash. Specifying -1 for maxrows will download the full set of records for that field}

\item{record_count_only}{logical: if TRUE, return just the count of records that would be downloaded, but don't download them. This really only makes sense for contextual layers, because environmental layers have only one record per layer}
}
\value{
If \code{record_count_only} is TRUE, the number of records is returned as numeric. Otherwise, a data frame containing the field name and various attributes; an empty data frame is returned if no match is found
}
\description{
Note for occurrence fields: only fields that are indexed in the SBDI database can be queried (e.g. used in the \code{fq} parameter in \code{\link{occurrences}}. These fields are identified by the \code{indexed} column in \code{sbdi_fields("occurrence")}. Only fields that are stored in the database can be returned as part of an \code{occurrences} call. These fields are identified by the \code{stored} column in \code{sbdi_fields("occurrence")}. The calling syntaxes \code{sbdi_fields("occurrence_stored")} and \code{sbdi_fields("occurrence_indexed")} are for convenience, and are equivalent to \code{subset(sbdi_fields("occurrence"),stored)} and \code{subset(sbdi_fields("occurrence"),indexed)}.
